# Project Name: Payment Application

## Description
This C-based project simulates a card transaction system, encompassing three main sections: Card, Terminal, and Server functionalities. It allows the processing of cardholder information, transaction verification, and server-side account management.

## Sections

### Card Section
Manages the retrieval of cardholder information, including the cardholder's name, expiration date, and Primary Account Number (PAN).

### Terminal Section
Handles the processing of card data and transactions. Performs validation of card's expiration status and transaction amounts. Proceeds to the Server Section upon successful validation.

### Server Section
Validates account status, performs balance checks, and updates transaction records. Includes steps for account validity, available funds, and updating account balances.
